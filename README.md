# Hotwire Native Demo

A small Rails web app to demonstrate how to use [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev) with the [Hotwire Native](https://native.hotwired.dev) frameworks. The demo app is available at [https://hotwire-native-demo.dev](https://hotwire-native-demo.dev).

## Running Locally

Clone the repo, and then:

```
$ bundle install
$ bin/dev
```

The server is running on [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). You can open that URL in the browser and ensure the native app is using the same URL.

## Requirements

* Ruby version defined in [`.ruby-version`](.ruby-version).
