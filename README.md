# Hotwire Native Demo

A small web app to demonstrate how to use Hotwire with the Hotwire Native frameworks. The demo app is available at [https://hotwire-native-demo.dev](https://hotwire-native-demo.dev).

## Running Locally

Clone the repo, and then:

```
$ bundle install
$ bin/dev
```

The server is running on [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:45678). You can open that URL in the browser and ensure the native app is using the same URL.

## Requirements

* Ruby 3.4.2
