<div class="container">
  <h1 class="d-hotwire-native-none mt-4">Form Component</h1>
  <p>This screen contains a form associated with a Bridge <code>form</code> component. It contains a web <code>submit</code> button that submits the form and redirects to a success page after a short delay.</p>
  <p>Since the Hotwire Native demo app supports the <code>form</code> component, the web submit button is hidden and is replaced with a native button in the top-right native app bar.</p>
  <p>Displaying the <code>submit</code> button in the top-right of the screen is a typical convention in mobile apps, has the benefit of never being hidden underneath the virtual keyboard, and is always visible no matter where you're scrolled on the page.</p>
